# notes

This is a simple WAMP project that me and my partner did during the course of web development.
The main objective is to learn about the WAMP.

This simple project is a website that lets people write down anything they want (note) and save it by clicking the "Submit and Save" button.
They can retreive the note after the users click "View Info" button.
